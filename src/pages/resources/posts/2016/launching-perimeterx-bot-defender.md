Today, we are proud to be launching PerimeterX [Bot Defender](/products/bot-defender/bot-defender/), the easiest to integrate and most accurate service to detect and mitigate automated web attacks. This is just the first step in our long-term vision to bridge the gap between what is available today and what we believe is ultimately possible – easy to use, highly accurate threat protection for web, mobile and cloud applications.

In order to build Bot Defender, we had to rethink legacy web security concepts and design a solution that would be able to detect even the smartest of bots – while still being easy to use and deploy. Bot Defender leverages advanced techniques to learn as much as possible about the user, browser and network stack. From this information, it creates a behavioral fingerprint, determines threat risks and stops attacks in real-time.

Our pre-release customers have already been using Bot Defender since September 2015, and it is currently protecting over a billion page views a week for ecommerce, media and SaaS applications.

I would like to use this opportunity to thank the entire PerimeterX team in both our Tel Aviv and Silicon Valley offices. Releasing this service is an important milestone for our company, and it wouldn’t have been possible without the tremendous effort, experience and dedication of this group.

**_We are very excited to launch the most effective bot mitigation product, and we invite you to try PerimeterX Bot Defender today._**
