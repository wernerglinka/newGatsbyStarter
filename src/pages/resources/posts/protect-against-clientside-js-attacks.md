![PerimeterX Launches Solution To Protect Against Client-Side Javascript Attacks](/assets/images/blog/blog-thumbnails/cd-announcement.jpg)<br>

Recently we’ve shared a series of blog posts discussing the [evolution](/blog/client-side-security-blindspot/) of website application code and the [challenges](/blog/client-side-battle-against-javascript-attacks/) this has introduced for many businesses. We’re going to explore these concepts further...

In the digital age, your website is the front door to your company. It represents and drives consumers to your business but it also creates a security vulnerability that most organizations are unaware exists. As developers are relying on open source components, libraries and third-party scripts to speed their time to market, code vulnerabilities may get introduced. These vulnerabilities make it easy for bad actors to steal data from your business via PII data harvesting, digital skimming or watering hole attacks.

Knowing that the problems exist and how bad actors can compromise your website is just part of the process; understanding how to solve it is even more important. At PerimeterX, we are experts at mitigating botnet attacks and limiting the damage they create for your business. We have parlayed this expertise into detecting website and web application attacks as well.

Today, we are excited to add a new addition to our portfolio: PerimeterX Code Defender released in limited availability. Code Defender is a web application security solution that protects your website and web applications by providing visibility into scripts running on the browser and monitoring third-party script activities.

Unlike traditional solutions that only monitor server-side code, Code Defender enables web application operators to see what happens on the user's browser. It is a unique solution that identifies a spectrum of client-side threats. With Code Defender you can:

- Track page elements and gain visibility into scripts and their activities
- Get alerts on suspicious signs and changes
- Prevent data loss by detecting unwanted scripts accessing your users’ data
- Monitor open source and vendor scripts
- Monitor behavior and changes in client-side libraries, scripts and components
- Identify supply chain attacks

PerimeterX will be showing Code Defender at two upcoming conferences: Gartner Security and Risk Summit outside of Washington D.C. from June 17-20 and AWS re:Inforce in Boston from June 25-27, 2019. If you’re at one of these shows, be sure to stop by our booth for a discussion and demo. Or [contact us](/contact-us/) to learn more and to get a free trial of PerimeterX Code Defender.
