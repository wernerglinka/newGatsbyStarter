![PerimeterX strongly supports Pride Month ](/assets/images/blog/blog-thumbnails/pride-month-logo.jpg)<br><br>
Last July, I made a statement that said, “Just as we care about equal opportunity and discrimination in our workplace, we also want the society around us to care about these issues.” This is why Pride Month is important not just to PerimeterX, not just to all businesses and to all organizations, but to every society in every country. Pride Month is an opportunity to celebrate diversity and inclusion, letting everyone know that they are valued and supported - no matter their race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other way they choose to define themselves.

PerimeterX strongly supports Pride Month. Our company has offices in London, Miami, San Mateo and Tel Aviv, so we are global, and it’s critical for us to think and act like one global company. The issues that affect one office affect all employees of PerimeterX, the people they work with and their families.

In fact, supporting diversity and inclusion is not just the right thing to do; it’s also good business. Recruiting people who bring different perspectives and life experiences helps us build more innovative products and better serve our customers. Having opinions and experience from only one group results in monoculture and reduces innovation and creativity. According to the HR and diversity thought leader Josh Bersin, considerable [research](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/au/Documents/human-capital/deloitte-au-hc-diversity-inclusion-soup-0513.pdf) shows that diverse teams outperform less diverse teams and [companies that have created inclusive cultures make better decisions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/#4b5e52174cbf). Bersin found that inclusive companies are 1.7x more likely to be innovation leaders in their market. The Harvard Business Review reports that diverse companies are 70% more likely to have captured a new market.

Together at PerimeterX, we are working to achieve a culture that is inclusive and diverse for our employees, customers, partners and community. During Pride Month this year, we continue to support and celebrate the LGBTQ+ community around the world. We do this by marching together in Pride parades, wearing our #PXPride tee shirts or taking photos together during an office Pride celebration. Pride Month is an important time for us at PerimeterX to reflect on the past, and more importantly look ahead to the future, toward this ongoing effort to drive equal opportunity and create safe spaces where we all can thrive. Safe spaces drive innovation and, equally important, create a happier workforce - and a happier world. Please join PerimeterX in supporting Pride Month for this month, and in supporting inclusion and diversity every single day.
