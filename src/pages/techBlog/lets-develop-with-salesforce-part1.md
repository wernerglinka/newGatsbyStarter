Recently I got the chance to work on (and get certified ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰ in) Salesforceâ€™s eCommerce platformâ€Šâ€”â€ŠSalesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC for short). One thing I noticed almost immediately is the lack of community documentation of the platform, so I decided to document my road to developing a cartridge - a foundational concept of the Commerce Cloud Digital development architecture.

To kick things off, letâ€™s set up the development environment we will use throughout our development process.

## Step 1: Install the Necessary Software

**Eclipse**

Download and install the latest Eclipse from [https://www.eclipse.org/](https://www.eclipse.org/)

**Java JDK 8**

Download and install Java 8 JDK from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

**UX Studio**

Salesforce Commerce Cloud development and debugging is done through an Eclipse plugin called UX Studio.<br/>
To install UX Studio:

1. In Eclipse, select _Help_ > _Install New Software_.

2. Click _Add_.<br/>This opens the Add Repository dialog.

3. Enter the following details:

- **Name**: UX Studio (or anything you like really)

- **Location**: [https://developer.salesforce.com/media/commercecloud/uxstudio/4.6](https://developer.salesforce.com/media/commercecloud/uxstudio/4.6)

4. Check the box next to _Salesforce Commerce Cloud_ and click _Next_.

5. Continue through the _Install Details_ dialog until you are asked to restart Eclipse. Congratulations, you are now one step closer to starting the cartridge development!

The following GIF shows the entire installation process:

## Step 2: Connect to Your Sandbox Server

Now that you have all the necessary software installed, letâ€™s connect to our sandbox server.

1. Change Eclipse to _Digital Development_ perspective by clicking on the _Window_ menu -> _Perspective_ -> _Open Perspective_ -> _Other_ and select _Digital Development_.

2. Click on _File_ -> _New_ -> _Digital Server Connection_ to open the new server connection dialog.

3. In the _New Digital Server Connection dialog_, fill in the _server host name_, _user name_ (same as your Business Manager user name) and _password_ (same as your Business Manager password) fields.

4. Once done, click on _Next_.

5. In the _Code Staging Directory_ dialog, choose _version1_ for _Target version directory_ and click _Finish_

6. The Digital API will begin to download at this point (you can see the progress on the bottom right corner of Eclipse). Wait for it to complete.

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰! You now have a fully working development environment for SFCC.

In part 2 we will use our environment to create a storefront (the term SFCC uses for an online commerce experience/website) that will serve as the host for our developed cartridge.
