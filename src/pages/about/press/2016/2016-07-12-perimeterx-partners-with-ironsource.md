# IronSource and PerimeterX Partner to Combat Ad Fraud

## PerimeterX Bot Defender Joins ironSource Ad Fraud Unit to Prevent Automated Attacks and Fraudulent Ad Traffic In Network Demand

SAN MATEO, CALIF. – July 12, 2016 - PerimeterX, a provider of behavior-based threat protection technology for web, cloud and mobile, today announced a collaborative partnership with global technology powerhouse ironSource. PerimeterX [Bot Defender](/products/bot-defender/bot-defender/), a behavioral fingerprinting identification system, joins ironSource’s advanced Ad Fraud Unit to actively address the rising threat of non-human impressions and in-valid traffic, ensuring high-quality and security across the 80K apps and 7 billion impressions ironSource receives a month.

Ad fraud, including infringed content and malvertising is responsible for \$8 billion of lost online revenue annually, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, with automated attacks or bot traffic comprising a majority of that deficit.

“We believe it’s critical for companies in our space to take the initiative on combatting fraud if we want to see mobile advertising continue to mature, so one of our biggest priorities in 2016 was building an anti-fraud unit with multiple layers and technologies designed to address all types of fraud,” said Yevgeny Peres, VP of Growth, Developer Solutions at ironSource. “As part of that process we partnered with PerimeterX, choosing to integrate their Bot Defender because it has the proven technology to identify and prevent bot attacks before they pose a threat. When it comes to fraud, prevention is the best cure, and we’re confident in PerimeterX’s ability to adapt and defend against new threats.”

With experience that spans security through high-availability and web-scale infrastructure, PerimeterX’s co-founders have a deep understanding of the landscape and the expertise to combat increasingly complex threats. PerimeterX Bot Defender’s smart behavioral fingerprinting technology is based on hundreds of indicators profiling the user, their browser and network. The solution can detect and stop any automated threats with a simple JavaScript tag integration. By integrating Bot Defender into their Anti-Fraud Unit, ironSource was able to leverage valuable, real-time insights to quickly block potential attacks and ensure network quality stayed high.

“We are thrilled that ironSource has chosen to implement PerimeterX Bot Defender to detect and mitigate automated attacks as part of their comprehensive advertising platform,” said Omri Iluz, Co-founder and CEO at PerimeterX. “As the sophistication and volume of bot attacks continue to rise, scalable, powerful real-time threat detection will be the best defense. ironSource’s deep knowledge and understanding of the advertising world has helped us evolve Bot Defender to better identify and combat attacks in this vertical market.”

PerimeterX is an out-of-band service that doesn’t affect delivery performance and is compatible with a customer’s currently deployed infrastructure, including any content delivery network (CDN) or cloud infrastructure. In addition, Bot Defender provides robust reporting for analyzed traffic and threats, giving companies visibility and control into how and why items are being blocked. PerimeterX deployments already protect more than 1.5 billion page views each week. The collaboration between ironSource and PerimeterX resulted in the customization of Bot Defender specifically designed for combatting automated advertising fraud.
