_Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners and Salesforce Ventures Added as Strategic Investors_

**SAN MATEO, CA** – September 4, 2019 – – PerimeterX, the company that protects the world’s largest and most reputable websites and mobile applications from malicious activities, today announced that it has secured $14M as an extension of its [previous Series C](/about/press/2019/2019-02-11-perimeterx-raises-$43m-series-c/) funding round. The round brings the total amount of capital raised to \$91.5M. Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTCP) and Salesforce Ventures join Scale Venture Partners who led the round, along with Adam Street Partners, Canaan Partners, Vertex Ventures and Data Collective (DCVC).

_“Each day, the news is filled with stories about top brands that have been compromised by threat actors who covertly modify website code and begin collecting personal information from site visitors or users,”_ said Omri Iluz, co-founder and CEO of Perimeterx. _“This additional funding, and the relationship with these strategic investors, gives us the power to speed up the expansion of our product portfolio to stop the Magecart and digital skimming attacks we’ve read so much about. We remain dedicated to helping our customers focus on growing their digital business, knowing their consumers and brand are secure.”_

PerimeterX has recently expanded its portfolio to include three Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings that utilize a common platform. PerimeterX Bot Defender is a bot mitigation solution that safeguards modern web and mobile applications, and APIs. Recently, the company expanded its portfolio to include PerimeterX Code Defender, a web application security solution that can effectively stop Magecart and other supply chain attacks. It also acquired PageSeal and added PerimeterX Page Defender, a client-side browser malware protection solution that blocks unwanted ads and scripts from redirecting web visitors, to its portfolio. The PerimeterX platform provides common services including behavior-based analytics, sensors, detectors and enforcers as well as a user-friendly portal and actionable reporting. The SaaS portfolio is fully compatible with existing infrastructure including cloud services and content delivery network (CDN) solutions, and unlike solutions that require appliances, it is completely software-based and can be deployed anywhere.

_“We have been following the impressive growth at PerimeterX. With the recent additions to its product portfolio, PerimeterX addresses a wide gamut of web security challenges helping businesses and their consumers stay safe,”_ said Guy Horowitz, Partner at DTCP. _“We see growing demand for PerimeterX solutions and are excited to bring our global network and SaaS expertise to support the company’s expansion.”_
