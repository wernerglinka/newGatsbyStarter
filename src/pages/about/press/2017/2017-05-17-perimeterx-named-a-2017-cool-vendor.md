_Leading Analyst Firm Recognizes Behavior Based Web Security Company for Innovation_

**SAN MATEO, CA – May 17, 2017:** PerimeterX, a provider of behavior-based web protection technology, today announced that it has been named a Cool Vendor based on the May 2017 report titled, “Cool Vendors in Transforming Multichannel to Unified Retail Commerce,” by Joanne Joliet, Miriam Burt and Kelsie Marian at Gartner, Inc. This annual report recognizes “interesting, new and innovative vendors, products and services.”

“It is a great honor to be named a Gartner Cool Vendor,” said Omri Iluz, founder and CEO of PerimeterX. “With our ability to detect sophisticated bots and stop attackers in their tracks, we’ve quickly become a market leader for behavior-based web protection. We’ve signed numerous new large customers and made strides in building strategic partnerships with leading infrastructure providers, demonstrating that organizations are finally waking up to the threat of advanced automated web attacks and realizing the value of protecting their business and their infrastructure before economic damage is done.”
